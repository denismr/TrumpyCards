# TrumpyCards

A minimal online CAH implementation for heroku.
I made this in a hurry to play with friends, but I can eventually make it better.

It is online [here](https://trumpycards.herokuapp.com/).

I got the cards from [JSON Against Humanity](https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity). I only got the official cards, tho.
